This webpage represents a course project of University of Delaware CISC682 Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction.

## About This Project

The main product of this project is a workable cook recipe sharing social network application, where users can share their recipes and tag them by categories. Shared recipes can be searched and viewed by other users.

This project is inspired by cook-at-home experience in COVID-19 pandemic. To avoid risk of virus spreading, cooking at home has become the major choice for meals. As self cooking becomes more frequent, the need of learning and sharing cook recipes is growing.

Main motivation and target of this project is to research on user interface design of social network application on both desktop and mobile platform. As there are many existing social network applications, we plan to use them as user interface samples and research on features of their designs.

## Need Finding Process

### Survey

(WORKING IN PROGRESS)

### Interview

(WORKING IN PROGRESS)

## Prototypes

### Wireframe and Mockup Prototypes

(WORKING IN PROGRESS)

### Webpage Prototypes

These webpage prototypes are made to be interactable, by which test users can experience the user interface, and provide feedback on potential design flaws or problems if any difficulties occurred in test use sessions.

This [link]() is an example of candidate webpage prototype.
